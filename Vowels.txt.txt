I take these notes with the intention of them being a transcript of what is covered during class, plus any additional thoughts that come to me during lecture. I hope this makes the material easy to follow, and it also helps me be a more active learner.

I'm aware that some people read my notes to pass the bio ASE or as a replacement for going to classes. I'm flattered, but please don't blame me if there's something that I'm missing!
